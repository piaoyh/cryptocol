git commit -m "Ver. 0.1.0.0. Modules primitive and big_uint are written. In the module primitive, trait Uint and its implementations for u8, u16, u32, u64, u128 and usize, trait Int and its implementations for i8, i16, i32, i64 and i128, trait Float and its implementations for f32 and f64, trait Numeric and its implementation for u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, i8, i16, i32, i64 and i128, trait Real and its implementation for u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize, i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, f32 and f64 are written. And, the unions UShort, UInt, ULong, ULonger and USize, and their implementations are written in the module primitive. And also, in the module primitive, trait Large_Integer is written. In the module big_uint, struct BigUInt and trait Large_Integer's implementation for BigUInt are written. The traits Add, AddAssign, Sub, SubAssign, Mul, MulAssign, Div, DivAssign, Rem, RemAssign, Shl, ShlAssign, Shr, ShrAssign, BitAnd, BitAndAssign, BitOr, BitOrAssign, BitXor, BitXorAssign, Not, PartialEq, PartialOrd's implementations for BigUInt are written."
